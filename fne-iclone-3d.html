As such rather than trying to dive off the deep end like I did last time (got most of the way through a character body before I got waylaid on the hands and feet) I'm considering looking at programs like Makehuman to generate the base body and work from there for the time being. I feel like most of my interest is possibly in hardsurface/scifi and fantasy creatures like dragons and such but I still Программу Для Рисования Мультиков.

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 3D modeling and animation. I am looking at doing high quality 3D animation with iClone 7, CC3, 3D Coat, Bullet Engine, Phyx, Iray render plug in. I would also be running things like Adobe After Effects and Premiere. I dont plan on doing an gaming on the PC but would like to create 3D animations in the same quality ballpark as modern video game cinematic scenes. hello guys, the other day i saw a vid of someone sculpting a human torso on Zbrush and i thought to myself could this be a good way to actually improve my anatomy skills especially muscles? tho im the biggest fan of 3d art or sculpting, i used to play around with Poser and iClone before and i recently started using DAZ3d as a reference for figures , i pose the figure and draw it traditionally and i can say it helped me a lot the Genesis characters are decent I am looking for a 3d character modeler that is capable of producing a character model similar to this: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/winston-iclone-character-50694 Must be textured and rigged, with a focus on good facial blendshapes. Please PM me what the above would cost, as well as your portfolio. Thanks. Hello guys! I am a Unity developer and I am looking for an application in which I could do the following: 1. Create different human characters easily (sliders and stuff, without 3D modeling) 2. Rig them with skeletons that will be compatible with Unity animations. 3. Create/get/modify different clothes for them 4. Be able to import all of that into Unity So what I am interested in: 1. Is iClone a suitable platform for this? 2. Which exact packages (if a single iClone is not enough Hi, I would like to make some characters from games, movies etc. and looking for the right software. I know about stuff like Zbrush, but it's far too complicated for my usage. I have Adobe Fuse and iClone on my mind. Can anyone tell me the differences, maybe their pluses and cons vs each other? I would like to 3D print the models later of course. Thanks Hey guys! I'm trying to find a more streamlined way of creating characters for 3D printing. I've used Heroforge and have made my own in Maya, but I'm wondering if anyone has used something like Daz3D or iClone Character Creator for building minis. I'm currently doing a deep dive into the world of 3d humans with the goal of planning out a workflow, for the goal of a series of short films/cinematics for an upcoming project. Do you use a dedicated 3d human app, or just generally model everything in your basic 3D modeller and then export to your game engine of choice? Currently, I am aware of the following: Poser (I've used this off and on over the years since Poser 3. I like it, but it always seems it can ALMOST Hi everyone, I will try to be brief. Basically, for a performance, I need a real-time facial motion capture animation, which will be displayed on a screen while I perform in the same space. It doesn't have to be perfect, and crappy looks will work as well. Now, my experience with 3d softwares is minimal. I used a bit of C4d and Crazytalk, and tiny bits of Blender. Faceshift is gone. (is there any way I could find a cracked version? that would be amazing.) I'm recently seeing 
I'm in the middle of project where I'm trying to make real time mocap in Unity. I've got general movement (SteamVR) and lipsync (oVR LipSync), but I'm stuck on what my options are on already made eye tracking plugins. Not looking to do anything with the eye tracking such a just want to make a mocap'd character be a bit more lively and expressive with eye movement. ----------- EDIT This thread really didn't go anywhere, so, I was able to make my own list. if I missed any program, please. I need one that works similar to Animoji on the iphone x or like iclone 7, but that also lets me use my own custom 3d model. Also, if it doesn't have the option built in, I need a compatible program that lets me create the aforementioned custom 3d model. It doesn't need to be able to handle a complex or realistic model like iclone does, as mine will simplistic like animoji ones. Help on this personal project is not only welcome, but requested. Thanks My friend is starting to be on reddit soon She's using unreal engine to make a fighting game (Like super smash bros) But she also has plans for a rpg (Like world of warcraft) and she wants to use iclone the human 3d models as characters Is that ok to put in there?

TVD Forever Hey guys, I am really sad about the fact that there will be no more TVD episodes from the CW. But I think we can all participate in extending it. Obviously, it will be more inferior to the real show itself. As a hobby of mine, I do 3d animation and I have the skills to get dialogue and voiceover audio with thousands of dollars of investing over the past ten years and now I have become very fluent in the audio portion of this. So what am I suggesting? There are 2 programs Hello I am creating a short film using iclone I would like to have some people to vocie act in it. http://www.castingcall.club/projects/3d-animated-short-film. So along with returning this build, and getting back another maybe 200-300 for the case, power supply, and ssd, I'll have like another 1000. So maybe 2200 to spend? So 1000 goes to the Titan X, plus maybe 1200-1400 left over for the rest of the rig. Besides wanting to max out Crysis 3 above 60 fps on a 4k monitor, I'll also be getting into some serious 3D animation on iClone 6, Daz3D studio, Blender, and/or Maya (whichever one has the easiest learning curve with mocap and all that) Show us your work if you can and what programs do you use other than maya, after effects? I have used few software's in the past like flash, powtoon for 2D and iclone for 3D animation, but I've been lossing my interest in them. Please give me some review of the programs you use. I've lost my faith on most paid online reviews. I'm looking for something that also has text to speech (audio to lip sync) animation just like CrazyTalk for iclone. Edit: I have already used blender too. Sorry forgot.
