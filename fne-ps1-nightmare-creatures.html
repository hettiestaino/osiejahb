Silent Hill is a survival horror video game for the PlayStation published by Konami and developed by Team Silent, a group in Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo.The first installment in the Silent Hill series, the game was released in North America in January 1999, and in Japan and Europe later This is a complete listing of all the files in the Sony PlayStation directory, as of December 02, 2018 at 09:49 AM EST. There are 2729 midi files in the Sony PlayStation directory. Hello everyone! I'm looking for a game that I remember watching my father play when I was little. My memory is blurry because I must have been 3 or 4, but Here Is What I Remember: It was a first person game. The main focus was this large sword with a big hilt with either a jewel or an eye on it. It kind of just floated there, without anything or anyone holding it. You would slash back and forth and kill monsters (perhaps demons more specifically)  It displayed your combos on screen. 
Edit: SOLVED!, it was O.D.T amp#x200B; I remember the start but that is about it, the game was always night time(I think), at the start you go down a really big ladder, I can't remember if there were classes or characters but there was definitely npcs and a story to follow. It was more fantasy but I think there was a pistol at some point? and like a blimp/helicopter thing I definitely remember that on the cover or something, you like get dropped off from it. amp#x200B; Genre: Rpg/Action. Fought monsters playing as either a male with a sword of a female with two guns. Bosses had three life bars that overlapped as different colors ( as one went down you could see another color under it that would start to go down once the first one ran out) you were able to stun enemies with a red electric attack. I think you may have collected souls to spend on upgrades. Third person view, electric stun attack left enemies with red static on them until it wore off. Had an almost final fantasy. Nice to see Dr. Jekyll still getting work: #ps1 #retrogaming #letsplay #nightmarecreatures https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWflGFgEJsamplist=PLVWo06PjNqSqJYT7Ysfm7u7o9qXMP_tljampindex=1. Platform(s): PS1, MAYBE SNES? I don't think so, though. Genre: Horror Estimated year of release: 1994-1998 Graphics/art style: Top down, very dark game Notable characters: I believe it had something to do with a brother and sister? It's been forever since i played it. If I remember correctly, the intro to the game is the kids falling asleep in bed and then either dreaming or waking up in their house and all these shadow creatures come out to fight them. Notable gamepla. Platform(s): PC, possibly PS1. I was very young when I watched my brother play this and I was born in the late nineties, so it was surely an older platform and these were the only ones we owned. Genre: Horror Graphics/art style: dark and eerie, fitting with the horror style. I'm sure the graphics were 3D Notable characters: The main villain (I assume) was some sort of scientist who created monsters. Other details: Hey. I remember watching my brother playing this game way way back. I can't. My husband was talking earlier about a game he wishes he could remember the name of that he watched a friend play as a kid. It was an action RPG and he's pretty sure it was Japanese, for either the PS1 or PS2. The enemy was some sort of demon (that he says looked pale like a vampire) and the main character had amnesia but was able to fight the villain because he had a "Christian mark." (Don't ask me what that means, could be a weird translation, it was played in English.)

I'll take any offers from outside that list as long as they're comparable in value to the things in which you're interested.
