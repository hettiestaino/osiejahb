I didn’t originally plan on going on Sunday but I ended up buying a badge. I spent most of my time playing indie games and buying merch for all my friends who couldn’t make it. Downsides are increased attendance making Saturday and Sunday worse, PAX and booths not scaling up to accommodate more attendees. ampnbsp;.

I used to have a couple of different submarine simulators that were freakishly realistic, nevermind the old Jane's simulators, and I feel like they don't really make any games like that any more. I mean, sure, I could always simulate driving a semi cross-country, but with today's technology we could have fantastic realistic military simulators. Maybe I just don't know about them, but I want my 688-i Hunter Killer. After years sitting in my Steam wishlist, and after watching The Hunt for Red October, I had the urge to play something with submarines. For the longest time I thought this game was an Abzu clone, some kind of exploration simulator with no real 'game' to it. This game has been an impulse buy I haven't regretted for a second. Every time I sit down to play this game I feel like I'm getting something worthwhile accomplished. Building a base, upgrading my gear, going from chasing down bladderfish. This post is meant to be a thought exercise - "Knitting Simulator 2019" doesn't exist. Say Knitting Simulator 2019 is released, and its reviews are very positive. In addition to expanding upon prior elements of the series, it manages to perfectly simulate the relaxing atmosphere of stitching together thread, and allows for virtually any type of clothing or fabric to be created at the user's discretion. All of the hurdles of real stitching, like missing a knit three rows back, are everpresent

You know I was a big supporter of steam machines when they came out, one of the things I kinda hoped might happen is the Steam Controller would make Silent Hunter games playable on the TV. If console gamers could play a submarine sim, maybe sub sims would do better I had hoped. Now with steam proton you can run Silent Hunter 4 on the steam machine and it runs great, but. it is absolutely impossible to make any configuration work with the steam controller. I have tried for years Before I get into this, let me start by saying that I'm not here to bash New Gundam Breaker. But rather, I'm here to express (and listen to) opinions, concerning an alternate version of New Gundam Breaker (or concerning one's ideal version of Gundam Breaker 4). Having said that, let me also add that the following are my OPINIONS on how New Gundam Breaker (Gundam Breaker 4) should've been (should be) made; THEY ARE NOT things that I piously insist must be in the next Gundam Breaker I am currently developing a multiplayer subsim (submarines and stuff) and I find myself in conflict on certain gameplay aspects. To be precise, I am afraid my position is too radical and it will be of too much discomfort for a player, hence I'd like to hear a general public opinion on the subject. Death notices reduce gameplay depth  Death notices (aka kill feed) provides the offender with 100% precise, instant, always correct intelligence that strongly affects his further actions. Typical.

In the majority of cases that means a ship of some kind. Spaceship, Submarine or actual ship unfortunately my gaming knowledge is thin on the ground and extensive searching over many weeks is proving fruitless so I'm hoping that you peeps can help. amp#x200B; Firstly I'm looking for games that are '3D' I don't mind whether they are realistic or cartoonish, but 2D generally means. . and I'm awestruck as fuck! When the mobile vehicle bay said "you need to go to a deeper place to build this vehicle" I never imagined it was going to be half the size of my entire base and with a buildable interior like holy crap! I've tried to play as spoiler free and blindly as possible and now I understand why people love this thing so much, it's insane. amp#x200B; It's so detailed too, it's like a submarine simulator with all the engine things, the cameras, fire extinguishers
