My desktop is a Dell Optiplex 330 running Windows XP with a SoundMAX integrated sound card. Normally on my speakers the max volume is maximum earrape mode (everyone in the house can hear it and I don't even need headphones to have my ears hurt from it) and I keep it up 1/3 of the way since that's adequate. Well I was recording a video on CamStudio with the audio set to record from speakers when all of a sudden the speakers cut out. I unplugged and plugged back in and it works again

Windows XP SP3 32bit EVGA GeForce GT 520 Graphics Card I'm plugging the TV up through the HDMI port on the back of the TV going directly to the back of the video card. Video comes through just fine, but no audio. I'd uninstalled all audio drivers, reinstalled the ones needed for the motherboard. Hi all, I built my PC back in 2008 and have upgraded things here and there. My issue: Essentially what is happening is friends on Skype/Google/Ventrillo/etc. can hear my PC audio coming through. The louder I turn up my volume, the better they can hear it. If I mute my mic, they can hear my audio output even better than UN-muted. This means I usually have to play games at a volume that is set to 1-5%. I am to the point of considering buying a new motherboard, but that probably means. Hello, I have a pair of home entertainment speakers hooked up to my windows pc through jack converters and with a little bit of welding. I got a NVIDIA GForce 610 series graphics card and installed it and my computer told me the SoundMAX driver doesn't work and that I need to reinstall it. I went into my playback options and it told me that there were 2 HDMI options on the graphics card that weren't configured. I don't want to install a soundMax driver unless i have to because when i went searc. 
My computer suddenly outputs no audio. I have speakers plugged into the light green jack on the back of the tower, which produced sound until only a few moments ago. So far I've tried a pair of headphones which also give no sound. I used Microsoft's Fixit program, which did not solve the issue. I've checked the device manager to see if the audio device was enabled. There are several items under audio devices, all of which appear to be enabled. I'm not sure what I can do, but here is the informa. I recently installed a new hard drive in my old Lenovo n100 3000 and installed Windows 7 Home Premium. After several attempts I got the sound to work but had installed two different drivers before I managed to get it working. The method I used to get the sound to work is as follows: I opened C:\DRIVERS\WIN\AUDIO and clicked on "setup.exe" and ran that and it apparently installed just fine. It has the soundMax driver installed. Now the machine emits a two note clunky sound every few seconds My father recently got a new workstation at his business, and decided to give his old one to my sister to use. It is an HP Workstation xw8200. I decided to clean it up and install a fresh OEM copy of Windows 7 Pro 64x on it, getting rid of the Windows XP (64x, I believe) that was already on it. The installation went smoothly, but now I'm having issues installing the correct audio driver. On HP's driver website, they don't offer Windows 7 drivers for the workstation, and the 64x Vista Business. Something that works like SoundMAX audio driver. I have windows 10, so it's got to work with that. Things like APO confuse me so I'd just like a pretty basic, easy to use audio equalizer. I am trying to use headphones from the front panel jack of my PC. While they do produce sound, it is garbled and distorted. I.e. Music seems to mostly work but voices and sound effects are distored so much that they are almost unintelligable. It doesn't matter if I use a game or a youtube video as the audio source. I have tried using the same headphones from the rear jack, then everything works properly.

Specs: Windows XP Professional version 2002, service pack 3 Intel Core2 1.86 GHz CPU 2Gb of ram Last week, I just got an old computer from my friend (he bought it from his work) because mine got fried in a power surge. It's been working pretty well considering it's age and hardware except it won't record sound which is a huge problem for me as a musician. I've run the audio hardware test wizard and this ( is what it showed me. When I strum my guitar, the bar moves. I know my systems aging a bit, but lately I haven't been getting very good play experience out of it amp I need a fresh set of eyes to give me some troubleshooting ideas. At first I had a GTX 470 I purchased in Feb 2011 and I found it was BSOD'ing in League Of Legends, but not other games. My frame rate was OK but wasn't anything special. a Couple months ago when I was at a friends house, they were playing Skyrim on a 460 and from right there, I noticed. There's something extremely differe. 
Hello, I have a Alienware m9700 laptop that my parents got my for graduation in 2007. I have been recently playing SC2 and notice that frame rate will be around 31 then drop to 1,2,8,1,3,4,7 then back to 31. As you can guess, this causes alot of problems playing games. Any ideas to what i should do? (probably get a new laptop but i already have a work one so i use this to game) Hardware upgrades? Software upgrades? Im not very tech savvy but i can make my way around. Thanks! Processor: 1 CPU_Na. This one has me totally stumped. Have a panasonic toughbook cf-w7. Was running XP on it until last night when I formatted amp installed Windows 7. No problems with sound under XP. For some reason, I now have no sound. Even plugging in headphones. The volume icon shows up in the system tray amp I see the indicator move up / down when I increase / decrease the volume (as it normally does when it plays the system sound). Win 7 installed a sound card driver on it's own during the install. for some magical reason the sound on my IBM T60 isn't working I already checked if the driver was enabled,re-installed the driver and even did a complete OS re-instalation here are the specs: Windows 7 Ultimate 2GB DDR2 RAM SoundMAX audio. </p>
